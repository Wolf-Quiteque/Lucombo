            <p>Hi! I am a PhD candidate in Finance at the London
              School of Economics. My research fields are Asset
              Pricing and Financial Intermediation. I will be on
               the job market in academic year 2022-2023.</p>

          <h5 class="mt-3">Strategic Disclosure of Private Information (Job Market Paper)</h5>
          <p class="mt-3">I study how hedge funds strategically disclose their private information and their 
            trading behaviour in the setting of short-selling. I document the existence of two modal
             fund types: announcers and followers. Announcers, typically small and young hedge funds, 
             would (1) first increase short positions, (2) publish research reports about their short 
             targets, and (3) realize profits from falling price in a short time. Followers, usually 
             large hedge funds, would increase their short positions even after announcers exit.
              To understand the strategic interaction among short sellers, I provide a model to 
              explain how size affects hedge funds’ behaviour. Small funds benefit more from disclosing 
              when they face a threat of binding leverage constraint. In contrast, large funds profit from others’ private information by offering capital in price discovery.</p>

          <h5 class="mt-3">The Economics of Mutual Fund Marketing</h5>
          <p class="mt-3">We analyze the allocation of human capital
             towards marketing and sales by U.S. mutual fund companies.
              With using a new dataset, we show that a significant share
               of employment of fund companies is devoted to marketing and
                distribution besides portfolio management. Mutual funds’ 
                marketing employee ratio (1) is related to fund family size,
                 (2) predicts high subsequent fund flow, (3) is correlated with
                 a more convex flow-to-performance sensitivity, (4) exhibit a
                  non-monotonic relationship with past performance, and (5) increases 
                  with market volatility. We develop a framework based on costly learning
                   and Bayesian persuasion to understand funds’ optimal marketing allocation 
                   and reconcile the empirical patterns. </p>
